## Information about the app

It's a group work realized in the context of the course Programmation Java. We were given a template of the app with missing parts and the goal was to understand the global app's logic 
and complete the code in other to obtain the wanted view.

This project helped us work with Java and particularly with subjects like :
- File management
- JavaFX
- Server-Client arcitecture
- MVC architecture
- Event based programming
- Multithreading
